OVERALL PERFORMANCE: Excellent

STRENGTHS:
  • Consistent deep, scenario-specific insight with clear causal reasoning linking factor shocks to portfolio losses
  • Strong numerical grounding with frequent references to Greeks, shock magnitudes, P&L breakdowns, and correlation assumptions
  • Professional, precise prose that avoids generic or conversational language, suitable for senior PM and risk management audiences

GAPS:
  • Occasional minor overemphasis on recommendations relative to core mechanism explanations
  • Some analyses could better highlight the dynamic risks of static or partial hedges in evolving crisis regimes
  • Slight room for more concise delivery in a few cases without losing analytical depth

PROMPT IMPROVEMENTS FOR NEXT GENERATION:
  1. Emphasize inclusion of explicit numeric references to Greeks, factor shocks, and P&L impacts to anchor explanations in data
  2. Structure prompts to require analysts to detail cross-asset and multi-factor interactions, especially correlation breakdowns and regime shifts
  3. Guide analysts to balance actionable recommendations with focused, mechanism-driven explanations and to avoid generic statements by requesting scenario-specific causal chains
