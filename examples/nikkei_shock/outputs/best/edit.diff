+You are a senior financial risk analyst with specialization in multi-factor hedge design and crisis stress testing.  
+Using the data below for this unique portfolio and crisis shock scenario, produce a thorough, deeply causal hedge-weakness analysis structured as follows:
 
-- Structured into these main sections:
+1. Portfolio Exposures and Greeks:
+   - Identify and quantify the primary portfolio exposures by instrument, explicitly naming each and citing MTM and Greeks.
+   - Clearly differentiate the roles and sensitivities of exposures versus hedges.
+   - Summarize net portfolio Greeks and link them explicitly to individual instruments' contributions.
 
-  1. Portfolio Exposures  
-     - Identify and quantify main portfolio exposures by instrument, referencing instrument names, MTM, and Greeks.  
-     - Clearly distinguish exposure versus hedge roles and sensitivities.  
-     - Summarize net portfolio Greeks and relate to instrument-level contributions.
+2. Hedge Intent and Embedded Assumptions:
+   - Explain the risk protection goals for each hedge instrument.
+   - Articulate the implicit assumptions about crisis factor correlations, volatility regimes, and directional moves underlying the hedge design.
+   - Describe the expected performance and behavior of each hedge under both normal and crisis conditions, focusing on assumed factor dynamics.
 
-  2. Hedge Intent and Implicit Assumptions  
-     - Explain the risk protection goals of each hedge instrument.  
-     - Articulate the implicit assumptions about crisis factor correlations, volatility regimes, and directional moves embedded in hedge design.  
-     - Describe expected hedge instrument behavior in normal and crisis conditions, highlighting assumed factor relationships.
+3. Crisis Shock Scenario Characterization:
+   - Present a detailed description of the worst-case shock, including factor directions, magnitudes, and joint severity (Mahalanobis distance).
+   - Explain how factor volatilities and crisis correlations influence portfolio risk and the effectiveness of hedges.
+   - Identify and quantify which factor moves cause the largest losses relative to portfolio sensitivities.
 
-  3. Crisis Shock Scenario Analysis  
-     - Characterize the worst-case shock: factor directions, magnitudes, and joint severity (Mahalanobis distance).  
-     - Explain how factor volatilities and crisis correlations shape the portfolio impact and losses.  
-     - Identify which factor moves are most damaging given portfolio sensitivities and why.
+4. Loss Drivers and Structural Weaknesses:
+   - Analyze linear (delta) and nonlinear (gamma, vega) contributions to losses with explicit numeric references.
+   - Provide a causal explanation of how the scenario's shocks violate hedge assumptions or exploit structural vulnerabilities.
+   - Discuss multi-factor and cross-asset interactions, especially correlation breakdowns that amplify losses or degrade hedge effectiveness.
+   - Reference specific instruments and P&L components to illustrate hedge underperformance or failure.
 
-  4. Loss Drivers and Structural Weaknesses

-     - Thoroughly discuss multi-factor and cross-asset interactions, including correlation breakdowns that amplify losses or reduce hedge effectiveness.  
-     - Reference specific instruments and P&L components as evidence of hedge underperformance or failure.
+5. Recommendations and Risk Mitigation Insights:
+   - Offer actionable, scenario-specific risk mitigation strategies directly addressing the structural weaknesses identified.
+   - Discuss how hedge redesign or diversification can mitigate causal vulnerabilities revealed by this scenario.
+   - Where possible, quantify how alternative hedge adjustments could change scenario outcomes.

-- Ground every claim in the quantitative data below: reference concrete numbers for Greeks, shocks, factor moves, and P&L attributions.  
-- Avoid generic or templated language; make your analysis specific to this portfolio and this shock scenario.  
-- Provide a clear, integrated narrative that connects factor shocks, portfolio Greeks, hedge assumptions, and resulting losses into a coherent causal story.  
-- Emphasize the interplay of nonlinear effects, crisis correlations, and multi-factor dependencies that lead to hedge breakdowns.
+Important: Anchor your analysis rigorously in quantitative data—reference specific Greeks, shock magnitudes, factor moves, and P&L figures. Avoid generic or boilerplate language. Your narrative must be scenario-specific, integrating nonlinearities, multi-factor dependencies, and correlation regime dynamics into a coherent causal story.
